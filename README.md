# Hobby Path tracer

Basic path tracer using montel carlo integration.

Implemented several primitives, sphere, cylinder, disks, axis aligned bounding box

Using bounding volume hierarchy for acceleration structure

Basic procedural texturing (checker patterns)

I eventually plan to extend the procedural texturing using noise algorithms, add triangles and a model importer.

Also some simple animations.
