# Hobby Path tracer

Basic path tracer using Monte Carlo integration.

Implemented several primitives, sphere, cylinder, disks, axis aligned bounding box

Needs a proper sampler instead of just random numbers.

Using bounding volume hierarchy for acceleration structure

Basic procedural texturing (checker patterns)

I eventually plan to extend the procedural texturing using noise algorithms, add triangles and a model importer.

Also some simple animations.
